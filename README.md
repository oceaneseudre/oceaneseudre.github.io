# Curriculum Vitae 2022
**Océane Seudre**

![I study the mechanism that underlies animal diversity on earth, with a particular focus on evolutionary biology. I studied a wide range of topic throughout my research experiences,  from the ecology of bats and the evolution of sex in fungi and rotifers to the developmental processes of marine larvae.](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_415AB2A87FC262EAAF789DAD46A1BEFF1A0E6CB74A7100F37D5E3E84A372AEBC_1620285756231_IMG_2381.jpeg)

# Education
## 2018 - 2021. PhD in Evolutionary Biology. “The evolution of spiral cleavage: insights from organizing activity and body patterning in the annelid worm *Owenia fusiformis*"

**Under the supervision of Dr. Chema Martin-Duran.**
**School of Biological Sciences. Queen Mary University of London, UK.**
My PhD explored the mechanisms underlying body patterning in the marine annelid worm *Owenia fusiformis* and informed the evolution of developmental modes. In particular, I described the molecular and cellular signals required for the specification of the embryonic organiser and cell fate differentiation in this species. Further, I uncovered a conserved gene regulatory network downstream of these events to pattern body plan in this species. I also characterized the Forkhead family transcript of transcript factors in *Owenia*, described their expression profile and inform the evolution of these key regulators for developmental processes in animals.

## 2016 - 2018. Master “Natural heritage and societies”, speciality in Ecology, Biodiversity and Evolution (1st)

**Natural History Museum of Paris**  
Master «Patrimoine Naturel et Sociétés» - Biodiversity, Ecology and Evolution My MSc involves theoretical, laboratory and field studies based on ecology, evolution and biodiversity from genes to ecosystems. This includes a broad range of training, such as the evolution of social behavior, multivariate statistics, modelisation of life cycles, population genetics, philosophy of science and evolutionary interactions process.


## 2013 - 2016. Bachelor in Biology of Organisms (1st)

**University of Rennes**
My three year bachelors allowed me to acquire a general knowledge about both animal and vegetal biodiversity under a theoretical and practical framework. Classes covered different disciplines such as zoology, botany, evolutionary biology, ecology and ethology.


## 2013 - Baccalauréat (1st)

**Lycée St Paul de Vannes**

# Research internships
## February 2018 - June 2018. Measuring and characterizing the effects of epigenetic factors in the marine rotifer species *Brachionus plicatilis* investment in sexual reproduction.

**Under the supervision of Dr. Denis Roze.**
**CNRS UMI3614- Evolutionary biology and ecology of algae. Roscoff, France.**
This internship aims to explore the respective roles of genetic, environmental and epigenetic factors on the life choices of marine monogononde rotifer species *Brachionus plicatilis*. This is being conducting through the experimental measure of the organisms investment in sexual reproduction, taking into account and characterizing the impact of epigenetic factors.


## March 2017 - May 2017. Experimental study on the short term effects of recombination and sexual reproduction in a sexual facultative species.

**Under the supervision of Dr. Manuela López Villavicencio and Pr. Pierre Henri Gouyon.**
**UMR7205 - Institute of Sytematics, Evolution and Biodiversty. Natural History Museum of Paris, France.**
This study focussed on the short-term effects of recombination and tested the abandon-ship hypothesis. The filamentous fungus *Aspergillus nidulans*was used as its reproductive characteristics offer an ideal model to measure the effects of recombination and sex independently. In brief, it was noted that recombination elicited detrimental effects on *A. nidulans*progeny when originating in a stable environment with favorableconditions, but on the contrary provided significant advantages when the offspring was subject to a stressful environment.


## June 2016. Characterizing the impact of luminous pollution on the diversity of bats communities: importance of its consideration in conservation programs -

**Under the supervision of Dr. Christian Kerbiriou and Dr. Julie Pauwels.**
**UMR 5173 - Center of Ecology and Biodiversity Conservation. Natural History Museum of Paris, France.**
This internship involved both field and lab implications as part of Julie Pauwels’s PhD project. Julie is interested about the impact of light pollution on bats and how those impacts can be reduced and taken into account in terms of conservationprograms. My work consisted on the collection of data from the field (Regional nature park of the Luberon) as well as on communication and reflexion with local actors and management of the citizen science online portal.
